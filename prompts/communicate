When it comes to critical messages, communicating once is never enough.
The 5x5 communication technique involves creating a set of key messages
and five "when and how" ways to communicate those messages to a team.

This ensures that the team hears the key messages in many different ways and are more likely to understand and remember them. 

The core message is {selection}.

Create three key messages underpinning the core message and a matrix of "when and how"s to communicate them.
