Example:
An employee's weekly pay depends on the rate of pay and the number of hours worked per week. Employees work a minimum of one hour per week, and a maximum of 60. An employee who works more than 40 hours is paid 1.5 times the normal pay rate for all hours worked over 40. Normal pay is Â£10 per hour. A program is required to calculate and output the weekly pay for any employee.

Decomposition:
Find out how many hours are worked
Find out how many of those hours are to be paid at the normal rate
Find out how many, if any, of those hours are to be paid at the overtime rate
Work out the pay for the normal hours
Work out the pay for the overtime hours
Total the pay for normal and overtime hours
Output the result
