I am designing a strategy using the "How Might We" technique. This is a technique similar to root cause analysis, or five whys. For each "How Might We" question, we generate 5 new "How Might We" questions that would help answer the question. By answering the new "How Might We" questions, we get closer to answering the root question. 
For example:
How might we cook a roast?
- How might we work out the ingredients needed?
- How might we prepare a chicken?
- How might we roast potatoes?
- How might we cook gravy?
- How might we know how long is needed to cook roast?

Another example:
How might we increase user retention?
- How might we make the UI easier to use?
- How might we keep the user on the site longer?
- How might we find out why users are leaving?
- How might we make users want to come back?
- How might we communicate new features to users?

Another example:
{selection}
